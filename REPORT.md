# Evaluation Pipeline Report

## Architecture

The pipeline is implemented as an Airflow DAG (`dags/evaluate_agent.py`) with four sequential tasks:

```
prepare_run → run_agent → run_eval → summarize_and_log
```

### Task Responsibilities

| Task | What it does |
|---|---|
| `prepare_run` | Reads Airflow params, auto-generates a `run_id`, creates the `runs/<run-id>/` directory tree, writes `config.json` |
| `run_agent` | Calls `mini-extra swebench` with DAG params, writes trajectories and `preds.json` to `runs/<run-id>/run-agent/` |
| `run_eval` | Runs `python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation` against the produced `preds.json`, writes logs and reports to `runs/<run-id>/run-eval/` |
| `summarize_and_log` | Parses evaluation report, writes `metrics.json`, uploads the run directory to S3 (if configured), writes `manifest.json` (with `s3_uri`), logs params + metrics + artifact paths + `s3_uri` tag to MLflow |

Helper functions (`build_run_config`, `prepare_run_dir`, `run_agent_batch`, `run_swebench_eval`, `collect_metrics`, `upload_run_to_s3`, `log_mlflow_run`) are defined at module level so they can be unit-tested independently of Airflow.

## How to Start the Services

### MLflow (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd mlops-e2e-ml-pipeline
/Users/sairameshpv/Documents/Nebius/.venv/bin/uv tool run --python 3.12 mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001
```
> Note: port 5000 is occupied by macOS AirPlay Receiver. MLflow runs on 5001.

### Airflow (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd mlops-e2e-ml-pipeline
set -a && source .env && set +a
bash run-airflow-standalone.sh
```

## How to Trigger the DAG

### From the Airflow UI

1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Find **`evaluate_agent`** in the DAG list
3. Click **▶ Trigger DAG w/ config**
4. Paste the parameters JSON:

```json
{
  "split": "test",
  "subset": "verified",
  "workers": 2,
  "model": "nebius/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6",

| `task_slice` | `0:3` | Python-style slice of tasks e.g. `0:10` |
| `run_id` | _(auto)_ | Custom run ID; auto-generated if left empty |
| `cost_limit` | `0` | Per-task cost limit in USD (0 = no limit) |

## Artifact Layout

Every run produces a fully self-contained directory:

```
runs/
  <run-id>/
    config.json          ← all params used for this run
    metrics.json         ← resolve_rate, resolved/submitted counts
    manifest.json        ← absolute paths to every artifact + s3_uri (if uploaded)
    run-agent/
      preds.json         ← patches in SWE-bench format (keyed by instance_id)
      trajectories/
        <instance-id>/
          <instance-id>.traj.json   ← full agent reasoning + tool calls
        exit_statuses_<ts>.yaml     ← per-instance exit status
        minisweagent.log            ← agent run log
    run-eval/
      reports/
        <model>.<run-id>.json       ← SWE-bench summary report
        logs/
          run_evaluation/<run-id>/<model>/
            <instance-id>/
              eval.sh               ← evaluation script
              patch.diff            ← applied patch
              report.json           ← pass/fail per test
              test_output.txt       ← raw test runner output
              run_instance.log      ← container execution log
```

### How to Re-run by `run_id`

Pass the existing `run_id` in the trigger config to reuse the directory:

```json
{ "run_id": "run-20260701T035348-abba78", ... }
```

`prepare_run` uses `exist_ok=True` so the directory is not wiped. `run_agent` will re-run the agent and overwrite `preds.json`. To skip the agent and only re-run evaluation, that requires triggering `run_eval` directly from the Airflow UI (click the task → **Clear**).

## MLflow Tracking

All runs are logged to the **`swe-bench-evaluation`** experiment at http://localhost:5001.

Each run logs:
- **Params**: `run_id`, `model`, `split`, `subset`, `task_slice`, `workers`, `cost_limit`, `timestamp`
- **Metrics**: `resolve_rate`, `resolved_instances`, `submitted_instances`, `completed_instances`, `empty_patch_instances`, `error_instances`
- **Artifacts**: `config.json`, `metrics.json`, `manifest.json`
- **Tags**: `artifact_path` (local run directory), `s3_uri` (remote location — set when S3 is configured)

### Run Comparison

| Run ID | Model | Submitted | Resolved | Resolve Rate | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `run-20260701T035348-abba78` | Kimi-K2.6 | 3 | 2 | **0.6667** | With swebench config |
| `run-20260701T022650-fab9e4` | Kimi-K2.6 | 3 | 0 | 0.0 | Without config (empty patches) |
| `run-20260701T020900-57c900` | Kimi-K2.6 | 3 | 0 | 0.0 | Without config (empty patches) |

The config file (`mini-swe-agent/src/minisweagent/config/benchmarks/swebench.yaml`) provides the agent with task instructions, Docker environment setup, and patch submission protocol. Without it the agent produces empty patches.

## S3 Artifact Upload

The `summarize_and_log` task uploads the entire run directory to Nebius Object Storage (S3-compatible) after evaluation completes. Upload is skipped gracefully when the S3 env vars are absent.

### Configuration

Add the following to `.env` (see `.env.example`):

```bash
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://storage.eu-north1.nebius.cloud
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key-id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret-key>
S3_BUCKET=my-mlops-runs
```

### What Gets Uploaded

Every file under `runs/<run-id>/` is mirrored to:

```
s3://<S3_BUCKET>/runs/<run-id>/
  config.json
  metrics.json
  manifest.json
  run-agent/preds.json
  run-agent/trajectories/...
  run-eval/reports/...
  run-eval/logs/...
```

### Where the URI Is Stored

After upload, the S3 base URI (`s3://<bucket>/runs/<run-id>`) is:

- Written into `manifest.json` under the key `"s3_uri"`
- Logged to MLflow as a run tag `s3_uri`

This creates a direct link from the MLflow tracking server to the remote artifact location, allowing any run to be traced from metrics → remote storage.
